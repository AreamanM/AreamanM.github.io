Whenever I get into, or observe discussions where people have different views about something, there's always this underlying
pattern that I've noticed. This post is sort of related to my post on transperspectivism.

There's two distinct patterns I've noticed:

1) Sometimes, people agree with each other, but they don't realise
2) Other times, people disagree with each other but they don't realise that they can't really ever come to an agreement.

In maths, axioms are statements that are taken to be true and are used as a basis for logical reasoning. For example, we universally
agree that "Things which are equal to the same thing are also equal to one another. If equals be added to equals, the wholes are equal."
(euclid's axiom of equality). If we didn't, well, there'd be problems.

Our notion of right, wrong, good and bad is built upon a bunch of axioms, at the end of the day, there's no "proof" that
murder has an inherent property of being "wrong" or bad. One might argue that murder is wrong because it causes loss of life,
which in turn causes pain to those who knew the victim, and causing so much pain to others is of course a bad outcome, murder
is of course, "wrong" right? Well there's also no "proof" that causing others pain is a "bad" outcome, then one might say that



Sometimes, when there is a disagreement, it is not because one side is "right" or wrong"
